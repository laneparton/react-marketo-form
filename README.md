# react-marketo-form
A React component that makes it easy to manipulate and display Marketo forms using the form descriptor.

Note: This project is in the early stages of development

## What do you mean by manipulate?
The infamous Marketo-guru Sanford Whiteman describes an approach to translating a form by modifying the descriptor before loading the form on the page. Translation is just one possibility. Another possibility might be dealing with the godawful ways Marketo manages checkbox values or form rows. I'll include examples shortly :)
